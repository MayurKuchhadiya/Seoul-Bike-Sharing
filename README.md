# Seoul Bike Sharing Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on predicting bike sharing demand in Seoul, South Korea. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the number of bikes that will be rented in the future based on various factors.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **data:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **src:** Source code for the bike sharing prediction model.
- **models:** Saved models after training.
- **docs:** Documentation files related to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/seoul-bike-sharing-prediction.git
