# Seoul Bike Sharing Prediction 

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on predicting bike sharing demand in Seoul, South Korea. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the number of bikes that will be rented in the future based on various factors.


## Acknowledgements

 - Thanks to the Seoul Bike Sharing organization for providing the dataset.
 - Inspiration and guidance from similar projects in the field of bike sharing prediction.
## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

 - data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
 - notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
 - models: Saved models after training.
 - docs: Documentation files related to the project.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is located in the 'SeoulBikeData.csv' directory. It includes information about bike rentals, weather conditions, and other relevant features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
## Model
The prediction model is implemented in the 'models' directory. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast bike sharing demand based on historical data and features such as time, weather, and day of the week.


## Results
Details about the model's performance, evaluation metrics, and any visualizations can be found in the 'bike_sharing_demand_prediction.ipyb' directory.
